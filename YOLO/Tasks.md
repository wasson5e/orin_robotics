1) Determine the better model to use for the intended purpose
2) Retrain the model using photos of people that will be commonly seen
3) Freeze the sublayers of the model so that they arent lost, but added to
4) Train the model using Metal Shaders/GPU vs CPU on macbook
5) Check that the training is greater than 50/60% accuracy
6) Check the validation output
7) Find out how to get Orin to be able to use the CUDA cores when using the model
